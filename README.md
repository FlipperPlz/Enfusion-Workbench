# Unofficial Enfusion Workbench IDEA Plugin

This plugin will act as a reasonable alternative to the workbench application that comes shipped with Bohemia Games running on the Enfusion engine. Currently, this plugin is heavily focused on DayZ Scripting and aims to make the learning and writing process as seamless and intuitive as possible without excluding features that people love in the Official versions of Enfusion Workbench.

## Contributing

Contributions are always encuraged!

The convention used when commiting is heavily described over at the [Conventional Commits Website](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Please adhere to these standards if you plan on making a PR.

#### Loose Commit Guidelines
- Version incrementations and branch changed are maintained by me. Please do not touch the version when making a PR
- Try to keep the code flow as readable as possible. If you name everything correctly there shouldn't be a need for comment spam. Although it is a good idea to briefly document how the changes work if you are planning on pushing.
- English/ASCII only in documentation please
